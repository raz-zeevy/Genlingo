## Introduction
Genlingo is a desktop application developed in Python that allows you to effortlessly create language learning decks for Anki, a popular open-source flashcard program. By leveraging web scraping techniques, Genlingo gathers additional data from the web to enhance your language learning experience. It provides example sentences, images, and word sounds, helping you develop listening skills, stimulate imagination, and understand words in context.

## Features
- **Deck Generation**: Genlingo provides a user-friendly interface to create custom language learning decks. You can easily input your vocabulary list, specify card properties, and generate Anki-compatible decks with just a few clicks.
- **Web Scraping**: Genlingo utilizes web scraping to gather example sentences for each word, along with their human translations. This allows you to understand word usage and context more effectively.
- **Image Integration**: Genlingo automatically associates an image with each word in your flashcards. These images provide visual cues and enhance your ability to recall vocabulary accurately.
- **Word Sound Generation**: Genlingo generates word sounds for each word in your deck, allowing you to practice pronunciation and develop listening skills.
- **Efficient Anki Integration**: Exported decks from Genlingo seamlessly integrate with Anki, enabling you to import them into the Anki desktop or mobile app for immediate use. Say goodbye to manual card creation and save valuable study time.
- **Rich Media Support**: Genlingo supports the inclusion of images in your flashcards. By associating images with vocabulary, you can enhance your memorization process and reinforce visual recognition of words.
